the main problem we have x boxes and  y balls and we want to count how many ways to distrubite this balls into these boxes  
- each box can have zero 
let's imagine we have y stars  for y = 5  we have * * * * *  and for x for ex is equal to 3 we have 3 bars | |  we want to count how many ways to put it between or in borders or side by side stars 
  for ex -
      *|**|**   now this is one of options to put in the first box 1 ball and for the seocnd 2 and for the third 2 
      ||***** now for this first is zero also for the second and for the third is 5 

out problem reduced to --> we have y + x - 1 places  and howy many ways to chose (x - 1) from it which is (stars + bars - 1) C (bars - 1) 
  

--> what if there is a restriction such that any box can not be empty  this will be a little diffrenet 
we have * * * * * stars now we can only put bars between only ***||** and this is not an option also because the secnod will have 0 balls 
so now we have stars we want to choose from them (bars - 1) so the answer is (stars) C (bars - 1)


---> what if we have more complicated restirction let's take ex ---   a + b + c + d + e = 26 how many ways to solve this equation for non-negative numbers , it's usual stars and bars 
stars is 26 and bars is 5 - 1 

but this is not the problem - we are asked to solve it but  there is 4 out of this variable is odd: let's discuss a  way to solve parity restriction: 
let's suppose the four odd numbers will be (a, b , c , d) we force them to be odd by making a = 2a' + 1 , b = 2b' + 1, and so on and because 26 is even and it's clear that the four odds will be even number the fifth
number is restircted also to be even  --- > e = 2e' 
so now we have this euqation instead 2a' + 1 + 2b' + 1 + 2c' + 1 + 2d' + 1 + 2e'  = 26  ---> a' + b' +   c' + d' + e' =  11 , now we solve as usual but there is one thing from first we assumed that the four odd number is fixed 
so we will mutilpy answer by 5C4 the number of ways to choose 4 out 5 numbers
