# Problem: Integer Solutions with Parity Restriction

We are asked to find the number of ordered tuples \((a, b, c, d, e)\) of **positive integers** such that:

$$
a + b + c + d + e = 26
$$

with the additional condition that **exactly 4 of the variables are odd**.

---

## Step 1: Stars and Bars Review

The classic "stars and bars" method is used to count how many ways we can write:

$$
x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n = k
$$

### Cases:
- If variables are **non-negative integers** (can be 0), the number of solutions is:

$$
\binom{k + n - 1}{n - 1}
$$

- If variables are **positive integers** (≥ 1), then:

$$
\binom{k - 1}{n - 1}
$$

---

## Step 2: Applying Parity Constraint

We want **exactly 4 of the 5 variables** to be **odd**.

To force a variable to be odd, write it as:

$$
\text{odd} = 2x + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{even} = 2x
$$

Let’s assume variables \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, and \(e\) is even. We substitute:

$$
a = 2a' + 1, \quad b = 2b' + 1, \quad c = 2c' + 1, \quad d = 2d' + 1, \quad e = 2e'
$$

Substitute into the original equation:

$$
(2a' + 1) + (2b' + 1) + (2c' + 1) + (2d' + 1) + (2e') = 26
$$

Simplify:

$$
2(a' + b' + c' + d' + e') + 4 = 26
$$
$$
\Rightarrow a' + b' + c' + d' + e' = 11
$$

---

## Step 3: Count Solutions to the Transformed Equation

We now solve:

$$
a' + b' + c' + d' + e' = 11
$$

with all variables \(\geq 0\) (non-negative integers).

Using stars and bars:

$$
\binom{11 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \binom{15}{4} = 1365
$$

---

## Step 4: Account for All Possible Odd Variable Choices

We assumed \(a, b, c, d\) are the odd ones. But there are:

$$
\binom{5}{4} = 5
$$

ways to choose which 4 variables are odd.

---

## Final Answer:

$$
5 \times 1365 = 6825
$$

So, there are **6825** such ordered tuples.



# Problem: Number of Ways to Get a Sum of 10 with Two Dice Rolls

We are asked to find the number of ways we can roll a **standard 6-sided die twice** such that the sum of the two rolls equals **10**. We will solve this using the **Stars and Bars** method along with **Inclusion-Exclusion**.

To solve this, let the two dice rolls be denoted as `x_1` and `x_2`, where:

$$
x_1 + x_2 = 10
$$

and

$$
1 \leq x_1, x_2 \leq 6
$$

This implies we are looking for the number of integer solutions to the equation above, with the constraints that both `x_1` and `x_2` are between 1 and 6.

---

### Step 1: Total Number of Solutions (Without Constraints)

First, let's consider the number of solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 10$, where both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are greater than or equal to 1. To handle this, we can transform the variables as follows:

$$
y_1 = x_1 - 1  \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 = x_2 - 1
$$

Now, $y_1, y_2 \geq 0$, and the equation becomes:

$$
y_1 + y_2 = 8
$$

The number of solutions to this equation is $8 + 1 = 9$, which corresponds to the following valid pairs:

- (1, 9)
- (2, 8)
- (3, 7)
- (4, 6)
- (5, 5)
- (6, 4)
- (7, 3)
- (8, 2)
- (9, 1)

---

### Step 2: Applying Inclusion-Exclusion

Next, we need to subtract the cases where either $x_1 > 6$ or $x_2 > 6$ because both dice rolls must fall between 1 and 6.

- **Case 1: When $x_1 > 6$**  
  If $x_1 > 6$, then $x_1 \geq 7$, and thus $x_2 = 10 - x_1$ must be less than or equal to 3. The valid pairs are:

  - (7, 3)
  - (8, 2)
  - (9, 1)

  This gives 3 solutions.

- **Case 2: When $x_2 > 6$**  
  Similarly, if $x_2 > 6$, the valid pairs are:

  - (3, 7)
  - (2, 8)
  - (1, 9)

  This also gives 3 solutions.

---

### Step 3: Final Count

Now, we subtract the 6 invalid cases from the total number of solutions:

$$
9 - 6 = 3
$$

Thus, the number of valid solutions is 3.

The valid pairs (where the sum is 10) are:

- (4, 6)
- (5, 5)
- (6, 4)

---

### Conclusion

There are **3 ways** to roll a sum of 10 with two dice rolls.

---

### Code Implementation (Optional)

You can implement this logic in Python or any programming language of your choice to verify the results.


# Problem: Count Six-Digit Numbers with Sum of Digits Equal to 25

We are tasked with finding how many six-digit numbers have the sum of their digits equal to 25.

Each digit of the number \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) satisfies the constraint:

$$
0 \leq a, b, c, d, e, f \leq 9
$$

where \(a\) is the first digit, and it cannot be zero because it would no longer be a six-digit number.

---

### Step 1: Initial Count Using Stars and Bars

If we were to solve the problem without any upper bound on the digits, we would use the stars and bars technique. The number of solutions to the equation:

$$
a + b + c + d + e + f = 25
$$

where \(a, b, c, d, e, f \geq 0\), would be given by the stars and bars formula:

$$
\binom{25 + 6 - 1}{6 - 1} = \binom{30}{5}
$$

---

### Step 2: Exclusion of Invalid Cases (Digits Greater Than 9)

However, the problem specifies that each digit must be between 0 and 9, so we need to subtract the cases where one or more digits exceed 9.

#### Case 1: One Digit Greater Than 9

If one of the digits exceeds 9, say \(a\), we set \(a' = a - 10\) to force \(a\) to be greater than or equal to 10. This transforms the equation into:

$$
a' + b + c + d + e + f = 25 - 10 = 15
$$

The number of solutions for this equation, with all digits between 0 and 9, is:

$$
\binom{15 + 6 - 1}{6 - 1} = \binom{20}{5}
$$

Since there are 6 digits, there are \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \) ways to choose which digit exceeds 9. Therefore, the number of cases to subtract is:

$$
\binom{6}{1} \times \binom{20}{5}
$$

#### Case 2: Two Digits Greater Than 9

If two digits exceed 9, say \(a\) and \(b\), we set \(a' = a - 10\) and \(b' = b - 10\) to force both digits to be greater than or equal to 10. This transforms the equation into:

$$
a' + b' + c + d + e + f = 25 - 20 = 5
$$

The number of solutions for this equation is:

$$
\binom{5 + 6 - 1}{6 - 1} = \binom{10}{5}
$$

Since there are 6 digits, there are \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \) ways to choose which two digits exceed 9. Therefore, the number of cases to add back is:

$$
\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{10}{5}
$$

---

### Step 3: Inclusion-Exclusion Formula

So far, the number of valid six-digit numbers with a sum of digits equal to 25 is:

$$
\binom{30}{5} - \binom{6}{1} \times \binom{20}{5} + \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{10}{5}
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract Cases Where \(a = 0\)

We must also exclude the cases where \(a = 0\) because that would result in a five-digit number instead of a six-digit number.

If \(a = 0\), the equation becomes:

$$
b + c + d + e + f = 25
$$

The number of solutions for this equation, where all digits are between 0 and 9, is given by:

$$
\binom{25 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \binom{29}{4}
$$

We apply inclusion-exclusion for this equation as well. Subtracting the cases where one digit exceeds 9, adding back cases where two digits exceed 9, and so on:

$$
\binom{29}{4} - \binom{5}{1} \times \binom{19}{4} + \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{9}{4}
$$

---

### Final Answer

The final answer is the total number of solutions for the original equation minus the solutions where \(a = 0\). This is given by:

$$
\left[\binom{30}{5} - \binom{6}{1} \times \binom{20}{5} + \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{10}{5}\right] - \left[\binom{29}{4} - \binom{5}{1} \times \binom{19}{4} + \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{9}{4}\right]
$$

---

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of six-digit numbers whose digits sum to 25 is:

$$
\boxed{\left[\binom{30}{5} - \binom{6}{1} \times \binom{20}{5} + \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{10}{5}\right] - \left[\binom{29}{4} - \binom{5}{1} \times \binom{19}{4} + \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{9}{4}\right]}
$$


# Problem: Count Solutions to \(x + y + z = 48\) where \(x < y < z\)

We are tasked with finding the number of solutions to the equation:

$$
x + y + z = 48
$$

where \(x, y, z\) are positive integers and the restriction is that \(x < y < z\), meaning the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are distinct.

---

### Step 1: General Count Using Stars and Bars

Without any constraints, we would count the number of solutions to this equation where \(x, y, z \geq 0\) using the stars and bars method. The number of ways to do this is given by:

$$
\binom{48 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{50}{2}
$$

However, this includes solutions where \(x = y\), \(y = z\), or \(x = z\), which we do not want. So, we need to exclude those cases.

---

### Step 2: Excluding Invalid Cases

#### Case 1: \(x = y\)

If \(x = y\), then we rewrite the equation as:

$$
2x + z = 48
$$

Solving for \(z\):

$$
z = 48 - 2x
$$

For this equation to have solutions, \(x\) must be an integer such that \(z\) is positive, i.e., \(48 - 2x > 0\), which gives \(x < 24\). The number of possible values for \(x\) is from 1 to 23, so there are 23 solutions. Now, we need to consider the fact that there are 3 ways to select which two of the three variables \(x, y, z\) are equal, namely \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\). Therefore, the number of cases where \(x = y\) (or similarly for other pairs of equal digits) is:

$$
\binom{3}{2} \times 23 = 3 \times 23 = 69
$$

#### Case 2: All Variables Equal

The case where \(x = y = z\) leads to the equation:

$$
3x = 48
$$

which has no integer solution because 48 is not divisible by 3. Thus, this case contributes 0 solutions.

---

### Step 3: Final Count Using Inclusion-Exclusion

We now apply inclusion-exclusion to subtract the cases where any two variables are equal. The final formula for the number of solutions is:

$$
\binom{50}{2} - 3 \times 23 - 1
$$

Breaking it down:

1. \(\binom{50}{2}\) counts all solutions without restrictions.
2. \(3 \times 23\) accounts for the cases where two variables are equal.
3. Subtract 1 for the case where all variables are equal (which doesn't contribute any valid solutions).

---

### Final Answer:

Thus, the final number of solutions to the equation \(x + y + z = 48\) where \(x < y < z\) is:

$$
\binom{50}{2} - 3 \times 23 - 1
$$

You can plug in the values for the binomial coefficient and do the calculation to get the final answer.
