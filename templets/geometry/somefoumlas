if we have point (x,y) and we want to rotate it clock wise and counter clockwise 

newx = x * cos(theta) + y *  sin(theta);
newy = -x * sin(th) + y cos(th);

if counter clockwise 

newx = x * cos(theta) - y *  sin(theta);
newy = x * sin(th) + y cos(th);


all foumla for get and angles like cos(a + b) and sin(a + b) ... cos(a -b) and all things may be useful
